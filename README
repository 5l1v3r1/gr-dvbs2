The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-S2
transmitter, based on the EN 302 307 V1.3.1 Second Generation
framing structure, channel coding and modulation systems for
Broadcasting, Interactive Services, New Gathering and other
broadband satellite applications standard:

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302300_302399/302307/01.03.01_60/en_302307v010301p.pdf

The baseband framing, baseband scrambling, LDPC (low density
parity check), BCH (Bose, Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem), bit interleaver
and physical layer framing and scrambling blocks are from G4GUO's
DATV-Express Digital Amateur Television project datvexpress_gui
(https://github.com/G4GUO/datvexpress_gui/tree/master/DVB-S2)
and converted to GnuRadio 3.7.x.

A gnuradio-companion flowgraph (dvbs2_tx.grc) for the bladeRF
transmit capable SDR is included along with a stand-alone
Python script for bladeRF (dvbs2-blade.py).

Note: This implementation only supports the Single Transport
Stream Broadcast services mode. Optional Broadcast services
configurations supported are 1/4, 1/3 and 2/5 code rates,
16APSK and 32APSK.

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!
